    - Laminated Bow Mat-Style
    - "Our laminated Mat-Style Fenders are constructed using a 1 1/2\" round bar skeletal frame. Nylon reinforced synthetic rubber, sculpted to a specific size, is then installed by hand, one at a time onto the skeletal frame. Hydraulic pressure in excess of ten (10) tons is used to press the treads tight against one another. Ends are then fitted with plate or steel angle. Weldless steel rings are installed among the treads at strategic points throughout the fender, which are then used to secure the fender to the boat hull. "

    - Turk's Head Bow Fenders
    - Turk's Head Bow Fenders
    - "The Turk's Head is ideal for model bow or tugs with a sharp bow because the laminations run horizontally, preventing the sharp bow from working between the laminations.\r\n\
      Turk's Head Bow Fenders are adjustable to fit most model bow tugs and can also be used as a lower bow fender on larger tugs. "

    - The Laminated D-Shape
    - "The laminated D-Shape  is often chosen because it enables fendering systems to be changed-out in one (1) foot segments, as they are designed to be stacked up one on top of another.\r\n\
      Laminated D-Shape Fenders are designed to fit various hull configurations. Each fender is independently mounted to the hull. "

    - Of all the side fenders available, the Hip Fenders are the most important. Viking offers a variety of hip fenders for different applications. For instance, ship docking hip fenders are thick and absorb a multitude of energy. The thickness allows the tug to work closer to the bow and stern of the ship without making contact with the wheel house of the tug. Viking also offers wheel house fenders so even if contact is made, it won't be metal to metal.

    - "Viking offers a variety of stern fenders for both bulwark and waist areas. (See photos below)\n\n\
      Tug owners often wish their fender was longer so the wire wouldn't catch it. Our recommendation for harbor and river tugboats is to fender completely around the stern and far enough up the sides so wires and hawsers can't foul on the forward end of a fender\n\n\
      In designing stern fenders, Viking ensures that all hardware and rubber do not protrude about the rail, where contact could be made with the wire and/or hawser. Viking Sidewall Stern Fenders offer a uniform conical surface that allows wire lines to slide over it smoothly.\n\n\
      We also relegate and seams to areas where the wire or hawser has the least chance of fetching up in them. "

    - Viking Fender has special expertise in Notch Fendering. In this category, the term 'Fendering System' is most appropriate because the Bow Fenders work in perfect harmony with the Side Fenders when a tugboat fits properly in a barge. Proper Notch Fendering allows the tug to stay in notch in a more severe sea-way than a sloppy fit would permit, thereby helping the tug to maintain better control.

    - "Viking \"Softlite Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are the longest lived, lightest heavy-duty ship and pier fenders available. In addition to durability and performance, \"Softlite\" Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are easier to use, safer to handle and require fewer personnel and lighter equipment to deploy and retrieve.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"Softlite\" Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are made of spirally welded, ionically cross-linked ionomer foam. Ionomer resins are high grade termoplastic polymers that have the unique ability to link with neighboring molecular chains with the same bond as the polymer chain itself. Softlite ionomer foam is considered the toughest, most durable, flexible low density, closed-cell foam on the market.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"Softlite\" Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are finished with an integral skin of higher density foam that is flexible, tough, and non-abrasive and which is welded into the structure of the fender with the same ionic bond.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Because of the unique ionomer foam construction, the fenders have unsurpassed strength and integrity combined with high energy absorption and a skin that is at the same time exceptionally tough and non-abrasive.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Viking \"Softlite\" Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are manufactured in sizes from 8\" X 24\" up to 12' X 24'. Small sizes are single pieces, while larger sizes are manufactured in modules for simplicity and lower cost of replacement.\r\n\
