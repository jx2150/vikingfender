    - Laminated Bow Mat-Style
    - Laminated Bow Mat-Style
    - "Our laminated Mat-Style Fenders are constructed using a 1 1/2\" round bar skeletal frame. Nylon reinforced synthetic rubber, sculpted to a specific size, is then installed by hand, one at a time onto the skeletal frame. Hydraulic pressure in excess of ten (10) tons is used to press the treads tight against one another. Ends are then fitted with plate or steel angle. Weldless steel rings are installed among the treads at strategic points throughout the fender, which are then used to secure the fender to the boat hull. "

    - "The Turk's Head is ideal for model bow or tugs with a sharp bow because the laminations run horizontally, preventing the sharp bow from working between the laminations.\r\n\
      Turk's Head Bow Fenders are adjustable to fit most model bow tugs and can also be used as a lower bow fender on larger tugs. "

    - The Laminated D-Shape

    - "Viking \"Softlite Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are the longest lived, lightest heavy-duty ship and pier fenders available. In addition to durability and performance, \"Softlite\" Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are easier to use, safer to handle and require fewer personnel and lighter equipment to deploy and retrieve.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"Softlite\" Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are made of spirally welded, ionically cross-linked ionomer foam. Ionomer resins are high grade termoplastic polymers that have the unique ability to link with neighboring molecular chains with the same bond as the polymer chain itself. Softlite ionomer foam is considered the toughest, most durable, flexible low density, closed-cell foam on the market.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"Softlite\" Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are finished with an integral skin of higher density foam that is flexible, tough, and non-abrasive and which is welded into the structure of the fender with the same ionic bond.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Because of the unique ionomer foam construction, the fenders have unsurpassed strength and integrity combined with high energy absorption and a skin that is at the same time exceptionally tough and non-abrasive.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Viking \"Softlite\" Foam Ship and Pier Fenders are manufactured in sizes from 8\" X 24\" up to 12' X 24'. Small sizes are single pieces, while larger sizes are manufactured in modules for simplicity and lower cost of replacement.\r\n\
